Trustpilot is a service that solicits, processes, and stores reviews of your business from your customers. By generating unique links made up of your customer's individual personal and transactional data, you can direct them to a suitable survey.
In addition to gaining valuable feedback, you could use their responses in your marketing to improve conversion rates.

To generate unique links, you will need a .csv file that looks like this:

Customer Name | Customer E-mail Address | Customer's most recent Order Reference | The domain name of your site that they visited | The secret key for that domain name that Trustpilot gave you

Alternatively, you can enter all of this information into the form to generate unique links one at a time.

To start, run the solution locally and append /Home/Index to the address bar.
