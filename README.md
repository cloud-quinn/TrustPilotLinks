# TotallyMoney.com's Trustpilot Unique Link Generator

<a href="http://www.trustpilot.com">Trustpilot</a> is a service that solicits, processes, and stores reviews of your business from your customers. By generating unique links made up of your customers' individual personal and transactional data, you can seamlessly direct them to a suitable survey.

In addition to gaining valuable feedback, you could use their responses in your marketing to improve conversion rates.

<strong><a href="http://www.totallymoney.com">TotallyMoney.com</a>'s Trustpilot Unique Link Generator</strong> takes your customers' details and generates the links for you. Then, all you need to do is e-mail the links to your customers and wait for their feedback.

To generate unique links using this application, you will need a .csv file that looks like this:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Customer Name</td>
        <td>Customer E-mail</td>
        <td>Unique Customer ID<sup>1</sup></td>
        <td>Domain Name<sup>2</sup></td>
        <td>Secret Key<sup>3</sup></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>"John Doe"</td>
        <td>"test@example.com"</td>
        <td>"CUST2015"</td>
        <td>"mysite.com"</td>
        <td>"mys3cr3tk3y2015"</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<sup>1</sup> Your link must include a unique reference to the customer, such as a customer ID, order ID, or visit ID. Using an Order ID can help you identify which product(s) your customer bought, and when.

<sup>2</sup> Your domain name on Trustpilot, e.g. "mysite.com".

<sup>3</sup> Each domain has its own key which must be kept secret at all times. This key is provided by Trustpilot. To get started, ask your account manager for your secret key.

Alternatively, you can enter all of this information into the form to generate unique links one at a time.

This application, and its code, is free for you to use and adapt, with no restrictions, when creating your own unique links.
